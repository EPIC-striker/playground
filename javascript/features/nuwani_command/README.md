# The `/nuwani` command
In-game staff is able to inspect and manage the IRC bots through the `/nuwani` command. Access to
this command is restricted to Management members by default, but that can be configured through
the `/lvp access` command.

_Currently the `/nuwani` command will output the number of connected bots. More functionality will be added as time goes on._
