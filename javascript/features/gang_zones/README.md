# Gang zones
Las Venturas Playground supports [Gangs](../gangs/), groups of players working together towards
dominance on the server. Each gang member is able to have one or multiple [Houses](../houses/),
which often are located together to form a feeling of coherency.

We now support _gang zones_, which indicates such areas on the map based on the gang's identity
color. This marks the area as being distinctively theirs, and grants them access to ownership of
the area, and thus the ability to manage and change its aesthetics well beyond individual houses.

## Determination of _zone dominance_
Gang zones are created for areas in which a gang has assured _zone dominance_. This is determined
in the following mechanism, which gangs can directly influence:

  1. **Identification of active gang members**. This is done by considering all players on Las
     Venturas Playground who are part of a gang, and have recently been in-game. _Recency_ here
     is influenced by the player's total online time.

  1. **Identification of active gangs**. Each gang which has at least five active gang members
     will be considered active, and is eligible to receive a gang zone.

### Determining _recently_ active gang members
Gang members are considered to be recently active when:

  1. They have been in-game in the past 6 months, or,
  1. They have been in-game in the past 12 months and have >200 hours of in-game time, or,
  1. They have been in-game in the past 24 months and have >1000 hours of in-game time, or,
  1. They have >1500 hours of in-game time.

There are no exceptions for VIP members or administrators, although they naturally tend to have
spent more time on Las Venturas Playground.
