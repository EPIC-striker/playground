# Reaction tests
One of Las Venturas Playground's key feature are reaction tests, which ask players to repeat
characters, solve simple calculations, or do a variety of other activities at certain intervals.

This is the code that implements these games. There currently are three implemented:

  1. TODO
  1. TODO
  1. TODO

The frequency and jitter between reaction tests is controllable through the `/lvp settings` command
by Management members, but defaults to once per approximately ten minutes.
