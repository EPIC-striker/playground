# Features
This directory contains the _features_ of Las Venturas Playground that have been implemented in
JavaScript. Let's begin with defining some of the terminology we use here.

  - A **feature** is _a grouped set of capabilities_. This could be a category of commands, for
    example teleportation or communication, a concept, for example friends or gangs, or something
    that isn't immediately available to the player, for example ways to make an announcement.

  - Every feature is **encapsulated**. It cannot talk to other features unless it **declares a
    dependency**. Circular dependencies are not allowed between features, that means that if
    _FeatureA_ depends on _FeatureB_, _FeatureB_ cannot depend on _FeatureA_.

  - Features should be **automatically tested**. The JavaScript code has been designed to enable
    easy and effective integration testing, which makes sure we can minimize the amount of bugs.

There is no limit to how small or large a feature can be, but try to think of features in layers:
perhaps you can split up your _feature_ in several smaller features, which will make it much easier
to implement and test accordingly.

## List of features
