# Punishments
Sometimes players fail to follow the rules, in which case administrators and Management members
need to have the ability to interject. This feature provides the ability to do so in a variety
of ways, from disconnecting players from the server (_"kick"_), to disallowing them to access
the server for a period of time (_"ban"_).

# In-game commands

# Nuwani commands
A series of punishment-related Nuwani commands are provided as well. Their documentation has been
centralized [in the `nuwani_commands` feature](../nuwani_commands/).
