/**
 * The Timer Controller will manage dispatching of function invocations at given intervals, lists
 * for which will be created during compile time by the PreCompiler. Because SA-MP's implementation
 * of timers is less than ideal, we'll be curating only three actual timers, and using counters to
 * create virtual timers. Shortest interval is 250ms, the longest is a minute.
 *
 * Using a timer for your feature should be done by using an invocation list annotation. The
 * available invocation lists are as follows:
 *
 * HighResolutionTimer  - Invoked every 250 milliseconds.
 * SecondTimer          - Invoked every second.
 * SecondTimerPerPlayer - Invoked every second for each online player.
 * TwoSecondTimer       - Invoked every two seconds.
 * FiveSecondTimer      - Invoked every five seconds.
 * TenSecondTimer       - Invoked every ten seconds.
 * MinuteTimer          - Invoked every minute.
 * MinuteTimerPerPlayer - Invoked every minute for each online player.
 *
 * As an example, a method that should be invoked every second could be written down as this:
 *
 * class MyFeature {
 *     @list(SecondTimer)
 *     public processControl() {
 *         printf("Hello, World!");
 *     }
 * };
 *
 * Note that the ten and thirty second tickers don't start ticking at zero. We do this to make sure
 * that there won't be four timers running in a single iteration, thus spreading the load.
