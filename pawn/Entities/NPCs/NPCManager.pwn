/**
 * Non player characters are a cool way of improving the user experience. They could be guards for
 * animation, managing train, flight or taxi services or be great friends for our large share of
 * forever alone players. Using them has been unified in this class.
 *
 * Requesting a new player character for any given feature is a rather easy process. The class
 * implementing the feature (or controlling the feature's NPCs) can choose to implement a number of
 * switch-listed methods, which allows it to listen to events about the created NPC. The Manager
 * will take care of invocating these when it's appropriate.
 *
 * The following code gives an example as to how a simple NPC owning feature can be written. The
 * NPCManager and the NonPlayerCharacter class implementation will take care of routing all these
 * events to the right class, and the events will only be invoked in your class.
 *
 * class MyFeature {
 *     const MyFeatureId = @counter(NpcHandler);
 *     public __construct() {
 *         NPCManager->request("RussellBot", "russellbot.pwn", MyFeatureId, -1);
 *     }
 *
 *     @switch(OnNpcConnect, FeatureId)
 *     public onRussellBotConnected(playerId, reference) { }
 *
 *     @switch(OnNpcDisconnect, FeatureId)
 *     public onRussellBotDisconnected(playerId, reference) { }
 * };
 *
 * If your feature owns several NPCs and it's being shut down, or needs to get rid of the owning
 * NPCs for other reasons, then you may want to call NPCManager->disconnectForFeature(), which
 * will disconnect all the individual NPCs for you.
